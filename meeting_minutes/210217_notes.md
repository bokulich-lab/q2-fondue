# Meeting minutes 21/02/17 
(including adjustments after discussion with Nicholas on 21/02/18)


## Main objective
* gather and align ideas         
* define requirements for first working version      

## Discussion points
potential **approaches** to start developping plugin:              
1) develop from scratch             
2) consolidating existing tools (e.g. magnify, grabseqs) into one plugin             

agreed upon **requirements for first working version**:             
* input: list accession numbers             
* output: sequences in fastq + metadata as csv (2 artifacts)             

**future extensions** for plugin to be added after first working version and kept as backlog for now:     
* upstream: including more platforms to extract files from (e.g. QIITA)            
* upstream: including input of project number or DOI of study        
* downstream: fastq processing            
* downstream: consolidation of metadata files across studies             
* downstream: checking for duplicated sequences + metadata files            
* downstream: visualisation on metadata and sequence data                            


## Next steps:
* Lena: to provide 2 SRA and 2 EBI numbers to start playing with (done)
* Anja & Michal: try out both existing tools (grabseqs - Michal, magnify - Anja) (depracated see update)            
    > update: look into [ENA Portal API](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/#/Portal%20API/doStudyLinksUsingGET) since according to our current understanding on the study content of SRA, ENA and magnify:        
    `SRA = ENA` and `ENA > magnify`.             
    (abbreviation funfact: `EBI` = institution hosting ENA and magnify)
                
* next meetup: 1st March for brief status update
