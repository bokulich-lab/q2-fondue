# Main objective             
* status update & alignment on next steps                         
             
# Discussion summary

## Status update:
* q2-fondue plugin structure stands 
* Michal working on action get_metadata
* Anja working on action get_sequences                       

## Open points:
* is sequencing data downloaded from SRA usually demultiplexed or not? Or are both possible?
	* @Lena to  check
	* @Anja to adjust inputted/outputted formats of get_sequences accordingly (current working assumption: demultiplexed)
> if sequencing data from SRA can be non-demultiplexed:       
  * @Lena to check info generally required by q2demux in barcode file
  * @Michal to check if this info is available in metadata downloaded by get_metadata


# Next steps:             
* Michal & Anja to finish actions
* Lena open point deep-dive
* @all to try out actions once finished & think about next extensions to add          

* 4th May: next status update + discussion on extensions
