# Meeting minutes 21/03/01

## Main objective
* status update

## Discussion summary
Different existing sequence and metadata extraction tools were tried and discussed:

* enaBrowserTools & sra-tools                  
(-) no metadata on samples available          

* magnify        
(-) does not contain all ENA studies; subset of ENA          


* grabseq         
(-) extracted metadata does not align with metadata from SRA Run Selector (e.g. for `ERR3978231`) as grabseq gets metadata from `http://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?save=efetch&db=sra&rettype=runinfo&term=ERR3978231` vs SRA Run Selector from `https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=ERR3978231&o=acc_s%3Aa`

> decision to keep sra function from grabseq in mind as we could fix it if entrezpy does not work.


## Next steps:           
* try out [entrezpy](https://pypi.org/project/entrezpy/)                   

* next meetup: 9th March for status update
