# Meeting minutes 21/03/09
        
## Main objective        
* status update        

## Discussion summary        
* Michal shared demo of getting metadata from SRA with entrezpy (see branch entrezpy-example) as well as a brief overview of edirect utilities        
* agreed that demo of extracting metadata should be further developed and looked into as it seems promising        
           

## Next steps:                   
* look through entrezpy-example implementation        
* align on format of metadata extraction        
* include download of sequence data (probably via sra-tools since entrezpy does not seem to have this functionality)           

* next meetup: 23rd March for status update
